Example Input:
Title: "The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Healthcare"

Example Output:
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by improving diagnostics, patient care, and treatment outcomes. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast medical data to detect diseases at an early stage, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide real-time patient support, reducing the burden on healthcare professionals. Robotic surgeries, AI-driven drug discovery, and predictive analytics are further transforming the industry. However, challenges such as data privacy, ethical concerns, and integration with traditional systems remain. Overall, AI holds immense potential to enhance healthcare efficiency, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes.
